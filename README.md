# Cards Training
This is an app (or will be an app) to help people studying with the method... I am not sure if it has a name, but basically, you have cards with a question or statement on the front and the answer on the back, so you read the question and think of the answer, then you flip the card to see if you were right.

This is inspired by WaniKani, but instead of a predetermined set of cards (which is what WaniKani do, because it trys to teach you kanjis) the user will be able to create their own cards to practice any topic.

Any help or recommendations will be appreciated.
